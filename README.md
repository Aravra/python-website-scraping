# python-website-scraping
My school has a website where a can see my grades, i made an python script that scrapes the website, and when i receive a new grade an email will be send to me immidiatly.
It is a fun project and my first interaction with python
To run it you need to fill in your own credentials and install a driver for chrome: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
I needed to do this to have access to the javascript part of the website
